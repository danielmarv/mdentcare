            Our Root Canal Treatment begins with a comprehensive assessment and diagnosis of the affected tooth. Our
            experienced dentists will carefully examine your tooth and take dental X-rays to evaluate the extent of the
            infection and determine the most appropriate treatment plan.

          <p className="text-gray-600">
            To ensure your comfort throughout the procedure, our dental team will administer local anesthesia to numb the
            affected area. We understand that dental anxiety is common, and we take every measure to ensure you feel
            relaxed and at ease during the treatment.

          <p className="text-gray-600">
            The next step in Root Canal Treatment involves accessing the tooths pulp chamber and removing the infected or
            inflamed tissue. Our dentists use specialized tools to carefully clean the root canals, ensuring that all
            bacteria and debris are thoroughly eliminated.

          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Once the canals are clean, our dental professionals will fill them with a biocompatible material called
            gutta-percha. This material helps to seal the canals and prevent reinfection. In some cases, a temporary
            filling may be placed to protect the tooth until a permanent restoration can be placed.
